# BEDI: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Embodied Agents on UAVs
This project introduces **BEDI (Benchmark for Embodied Drone Intelligence)**, a comprehensive and standardized evaluation framework for UAV-Embodied Agents (UAV-EAs) in autonomous tasks. BEDI leverages the dynamic capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and incorporates a novel Dynamic Chain-of-Embodied-Task paradigm, which decomposes complex UAV tasks into standardized, measurable subtasks based on the perception-decision-action loop. The benchmark evaluates UAV-EAs across five core sub-skills: semantic perception, spatial perception, motion control, tool utilization, and task planning. Additionally, BEDI integrates static real-world environments with dynamic virtual scenarios, offering a hybrid testing platform that allows for flexible task customization and scenario extension. By providing open, standardized interfaces and conducting empirical evaluations, BEDI identifies limitations in current UAV-EA models and paves the way for future advancements in embodied intelligence research and model optimization.
